# 1) Project Objective : Electric_Vehicle_US_Sale (Interactive Dashboard creation using Tableau )

## 2) Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs): 
1. Total Number of Vehicles
Gain an understanding of the overall electric vehicle landscape, including both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), to evaluate the market size and its expansion.

2. Average Electric Driving Range
Analyze the average driving range of electric vehicles within the dataset to measure technological progress and efficiency improvements in EVs.

3. Total Number and Percentage of BEVs
Identify the complete count of Battery Electric Vehicles in the dataset.
– Calculate what portion of the total EV population consists of BEVs to understand the prevalence of fully electric cars in the market.

4. Total Number and Percentage of PHEVs
Determine the number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles in the dataset.
– Compute the percentage of PHEVs compared to all EVs to analyze the market share of plug-in hybrids.

## 4) Insights : 

Electric Vehicle Distribution: Out of a total of 120,000 vehicles, 77.8% are fully electric (EVs) while 22.2% are plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).

State-wise Adoption: Washington state leads with 99% of its electric vehicles being BEVs, making it the top EV-adopting state in the U.S.

Top EV Manufacturers: Among the top 10 EV-producing manufacturers are Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet. Tesla dominates the market, accounting for approximately 52.74% of total EV production.

EV Adoption Over Time: The adoption of electric vehicles has grown exponentially each year from 2011 to 2024, indicating a strong upward trend.

Shift to Green Energy: Manufacturers are increasingly investing in sustainable energy sources, specifically electric power, based on trends observed from 2011 to 2024.

CAFV Eligibility: A pie chart analysis shows that 41.99% of EVs are currently eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives. Additionally, 46.18% fall under the “unknown” category, suggesting the number of eligible vehicles may rise in the future.

Top EV Models: Among the top five most-produced electric vehicles, all are BEVs from leading manufacturers.

Tesla Range: Tesla vehicles have an average electric range of approximately 90 miles.

Tesla Model Breakdown: Within Tesla’s lineup, Model Y accounts for 18.88% of their total vehicles, Model 3 represents 18.41%, and Model s contributes 5.06%.

Growth Trends by Manufacturer: Tesla’s production shows a consistent exponential growth trend, whereas manufacturers like Nissan and Chevrolet display irregular growth patterns.

Volkswagen’s Commitment: Volkswagen stands out as another major manufacturer producing 100% fully electric vehicles, alongside Tesla.

## 5) Conclusion : 
Electric vehicles (EVs) now dominate the market, accounting for 77.8% of all electric vehicle types, while plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) make up the remaining 22.2%. Washington leads the U.S. in EV adoption, with 99% of its electric vehicles being fully battery electric. Tesla is the clear market leader, producing over half of all EVs and showing consistent exponential growth from 2011 to 2024. Other manufacturers like Nissan and Chevrolet show less stable trends. The EV industry as a whole is shifting toward greener, electric-based energy sources. 41.99% EVs are eligible for CAFV incentives, and with 46.18% still classified as “unknown,” the number of eligible vehicles is expected to increase. All top EV models are fully electric, reflecting consumer and manufacturer preference for BEVs. Tesla vehicles average around 90 miles of range, with Model Y and Model 3 being the most popular. Aside from Tesla, Volkswagen also stands out by producing only fully electric vehicles.
